#    Theory

*   Monolithic  apps  are  easier  to  deploy,  but  harder  to  maintain  over  time  andsometimes impossible to scale.
*   Microservices-based application architectures allow easier development of eachcomponent, but are harder to deploy and configure to work as a single system.
*   Linux containers provide much the same benefits as virtual machines, but arefar more lightweight and allow for much better hardware utilization.
*   Docker improved on existing Linux container technologies by allowing easier and faster provisioning of containerized apps together with their OS environments.
*   Kubernetes exposes the whole  datacenter as a single computational resourcefor running applications.
*   Developers  can  deploy  apps  through  Kubernetes  without  assistance  fromsysadmins.
*   Sysadmins  can  sleep  better  by  having  Kubernetes  deal  with  failed  nodes  auto-matically.
